#### Data Analytics

Data analytics focuses on the analysis of big data. 

[Pandas](./pandas.md) and [NumPy](./numpy.md) are one of the most efficient libraries at handling and transforming the big data. They are built for speed, efficiency, readability, and ease of use.

*Pandas* handles all data-related tasks such as creating DataFrames, importing data, scraping data from the web, merging data, pivoting, concatenating, and more.

*NumPy*, short for Numerical Python, is more focused on computation, such as the mean, median, mode, and quartiles. It interprets the rows and columns of pandas DataFrames in the form of NumPy arrays. NumPy is blazingly fast in computing.

Another key player in [data analysis](./work-with-data.md) is *Matplotlib*, a graphing library that handles scatter plots, histograms, regression lines, and much more.
